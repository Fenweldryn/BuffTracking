## About

Slightly Improved™ Buff Tracking is a lightweight, good enough, effect tracker, for those of you who doesn't like to deface the game too much. I've spent a good amount of time making sure it look so stock you'd say ZOS made it but forgot to mention.

- Tracks timed and permanent effects.
- Display countdown and visual cue when the effect is about to expire.
- Highlight negative effects.
- Sits comfortably right above your ability bar and fades with it.
